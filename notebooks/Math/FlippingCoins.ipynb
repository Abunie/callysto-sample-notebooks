    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic statistics experiment is simply counting how many \"heads\" and \"tails\" you observe when flipping a coin repeatedly. With a perfectly unbiased coin in a statistically perfect world, one might expect to count an equal number of heads and tails by flipping a coin hundreds of times. However, the world we live in is far from statistically perfect. The real world is plagued with **statistical fluctuations**, meaning that measured data are not always equal to what you would expect. For example, if you were to flip a coin 100 times, it is likely that you would measure something like 45 heads and 55 tails. The reason for this is most of our statistical expectations represent an upper boundary of probability. In other words, if we were to flip a coin infinitely many times, we would expect exactly half of those trials to be heads, and exactly half of those trials to be tails. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on if you have hobbies or not), you cannot flip a coin infinitely many times. You can only flip a coin a given amount of times. In mathematical terms, the results of any coin flipping experiment will have a _discrete_ number of heads and a _discrete_ number of tails. Or, you'll have counted heads and tails from a set number of trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of statistical problem where you run a number of trials is easily simulated using Python. However, modeling trials of real world situations subject to statistical fluctuations requires something included in Python known as the **random number generator**. So, before we move on to how we can simulate statistical fluctuations, we introduce random numbers and the random number generator. \n",

    "Run the above cell a few times, are the numbers the same? They probably aren't. Is the fact that those numbers aren't the same enough to say they are random? Certainly they appear to be from looking at them. Unfortunately, this is math, meaning we need to understand and define the properties that random number should have in order to determine if the random numbers from Python satisfy these requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a sequence of $N$ random numbers $\\{R\\}$ with contents $\\{r_1, r_2, ... , r_N\\}$ where each element $r_i$ is a random number. What sort of properties should this sequence of numbers have? If this is truly a sequence of random numbers, it _must_ satisfy the following properties, which we will explain in greater detail: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drawing any $r_i$ is equally probable and independent. \n",
    "2. The sequence of random numbers is uniformly distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Drawing a value\" in this scope means we're picking a number from our sequence of random numbers, but not removing it from the sequence (the sequence remains unchanged, we're simply \"observing\" the random number). \n",
    "Let's look at these two properties in a little more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "### All Values Are Equally Probable and Independent\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that if you were to select (but not remove) a number from your sequence of random numbers $\\{r_1, r_2, ... , r_N\\}$ at random, the probability of drawing any of those numbers is\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p(r_i) = \\frac{1}{N}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $p(r_i)$ is the probability of selecting a number $r_i$. This probability is identical for all numbers within your set. More explicitly:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p(r_1) = p(r_2) = ... = p(r_N) = \\frac{1}{N}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The independence property means that the if you draw a number from the set, it does not affect the probability of drawing other numbers, or even itself at a later time. This is because the sequence remains unchanged after you draw (observe) a number. This property leads directly to the second important properties of random numbers, discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Numbers are Uniformly Distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply means that there is no \"trend\" within the set of random numbers. If you were to plot the histogram of all your random numbers, they would produce a flat rectangle, or the uniform distribution:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(r)  = \\left\\{\n",
    "\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "p & a \\leq x \\leq b \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{matrix}\n",
    "\\right.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(r)$ is the probability _distribution_ and $p$ is the probability of drawing any number between $a$ and $b$. It is important to note that this probability $p$ is the **same** probability for all numbers between $a$ and $b$. This function simply defines a horizontal line -- meaning that all values from this distribution are equally probable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, so we have some definitions of random numbers, let's test Python's random number generator to see if these \"random\" numbers satisfy our two requirements. Below is a python widget that you can use to visualize random numbers generated with Python. This widget will draw $N$ random numbers (that you get to define) and bin those values into a histogram. If you're unsure what a histogram is, think of it as a bar graph where the bars are defined by counting how many number land within a specific range or \"bin\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Certianly, the question remains of how exactly we're going to translate the definitions above into something that we can use in order to create such a histogram. Let's break down how we'll acomplish this into steps with the following flowchart\n",

    "![alt text](images/coin_chart.png)\n",
    "> A schematic diagram for the process required in order to test if the numbers created by the random number generator are uniformly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flowchart explains the process required in order to create the histogram in the widget below. Essentially all we need to do is create those $N$ random numbers, place them in the appropriate bind, and then count the number of entires that each bin has. These counts will define the size of each bar in the histogram. We also note that we have converted these raw counts into a percentage by dividing the counts in each bin, by $N$, the number of random numbers counted."

    "    - Run those three test cases again, are they identical to the first time you created the histogram?\n",
    "2. If the numbers you draw don't line up with the expected distribution does that mean our random numbers don't fit the expected curve using a small number of random numbers, does that mean the random number generator isn't behaving correctly? What if it doesn't line up when you include lots of points? \n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance to Coin Flipping\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection between generating random numbers in Python and flipping a coin isn't necessarily obvious. Why do we need to generate random numbers to write a code that simulates flipping coins for us? Well, the answer is we need some metric in order to decide which \"coins\" are heads, and which are tails. Unfortunately to model a real world situation, we need statistical variation -- we can't just use our expected probabilities to decide the outcome of the coin toss. If we did that we would only be modeling the expected result after an infinite number of trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the natural next question is how can we use these random numbers generated by Python in order to simulate something like a coin toss? To explain, it is important to keep the uniform distribution in mind. If you were to flip a fair coin, unbiased for heads or tails, there is a 50 % probability of observing heads, and a 50 % probability of observing tails after any given coin toss. In terms of the uniform distribution and the random number generator, we could make the following plot to describe a coin toss"

    "With the above widget, click the \"Toss these coins\" button in order to view an animation of many simulated coin tosses. Adjusting the \"Trials\" slider will change how many times the coins are flipped, and the \"Head Prob...\" slider changes the probability of the coin flip resulting in heads.\n",

    "1. Simulate flipping an unbiased coin with:\n",
    "    - 10 trials\n",
    "    - approximately 100 trials\n",
    "    - approximately 10000 trials\n",
    "    - 100000 trials. \n",
    " \n",
    " Do you count the number of heads/tails you would expect? Why or why not? If there is a difference between the simulated value and your expected value, is that something to be concerned about? Why or why not?\n",
    "2. Repeat the above with a biased coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we covered the idea of statistical fluctuations and how we can use the random number generator to model those statistical fluctuations. In doing so, we created a simulation of coin tosses for both fair and biased coins and observed the difference in counting statistics between the two. We learned that while the probability of a fair coin is 50/50, the observed counting statistics may vary slightly from this. This sort of model can be applied to nearly any statistical process, and can act as a primer for the idea of statistical simulations and Monte Carlo methods. "
