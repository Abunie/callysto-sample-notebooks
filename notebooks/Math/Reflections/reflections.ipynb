    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will see the reflection of a point, a graph, and a function across a line.\n",
    "We can reflect across any line, but we will only be looking at three common lines in this notebook:\n",
    "the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the line $y = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine looking into a large mirror.\n",
    "Your reflection appears to be on the other side of the mirror,\n",
    "and it appears to be as far from the mirror's surface as you are.\n",
    "In order to see your reflection, you have to look at the mirror straight on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep this imagine in your mind as we describe the reflection of a point across a line.\n",
    "If we have a point and a straight line, whatever side of the line the point is on, its reflection is on the opposite side.\n",
    "The reflection is as far from the line as the point is.\n",
    "If we were to trace a line from the point to its reflection, this line would intersect the line we reflected across at a right angle -- to \"see\" its reflection, the point has to look at the line straight on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflections across the $x$-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest line to reflect across is the $x$-axis.\n",
    "A point and its reflection across the $x$-axis are on opposite sides of the $x$-axis.\n",
    "The line from a point to its reflection has to intersect the $x$-axis at a right angle.\n",
    "Since the $x$-axis traces out a line from left to right, the line from the point to its reflection must be going straight up and down.\n",
    "This means the point and its reflection must have the same $x$-coordinate.\n",
    "A point and its reflection are the same distance above or below the $x$-axis,\n",
    "so whatever the $y$-coordinate of the point is,\n",
    "the $y$-coordinate of its reflection is the negative of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the point $P = (1, 3)$.\n",
    "Let's call its reflection $P'$.\n",
    "Then $P'$ has the same $x$-coordinate as $P$, but its $y$-coordinate is the negative of $P$'s.\n",
    "This means $P' = (1, -3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Suppose we have instead the point $P = (2, 0)$.\n",
    "This point is *on* the $x$-axis.\n",
    "Since $-0 = 0$, its reflection is $P' = (2, 0)$.\n",
    "If we have a point on the $x$-axis and we reflect it across the $x$-axis, we get the same point back.\n",
    "It is its own reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule:** For an arbitrary point $(x, y)$, its reflection across the $x$-axis is the point $(x, -y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a graph of the points $(-1,-1)$, $(0,2)$, $(1,3)$, and $(2,0)$ in blue and their reflections in red.\n",
    "The point $(2,0)$ is its own reflection, so we drew it in magenta, since the blue and red dots overlap."

    "We've also made a distinction between reflecting a point, reflecting the graph of a function, and reflecting the function itself.\n",
    "Reflections of points and graphs are geometric ideas, manipulating plots;\n",
    "reflections of functions is about manipulating equations,\n",
    "although\n",
    "\n",
    "The studies of statistics and of the sciences depend heavily on the skills learned in later math courses, especially Calculus courses.\n",
    "A lot of time is spent in Calculus courses analyzing functions and to do this, it is usually helpful to have a clear image in one's mind of the function being analyzed.\n",
    "Understanding reflections of graphs and functions is one step towards forming such a clear image.\n",
    "For instance, you might already know what the graph of $y = 10^x$ looks like,\n",
    "but using the techniques covered in this notebook,\n",
    "you can also tell what $y = -10^x$, $y = 10^{-x}$, $y = -10^{-x}$, and $x = 10^y$ look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing when a function is \"even\" or \"odd\" also has its uses.\n",
    "A typical question in a Calculus class is to find the area underneath a curve and above the $x$-axis.\n",
    "If the curve is given by an even function, then the area to the right of the $y$-axis is the same as the area to the left.\n",
    "That means we can get away with only calculating half the area and then doubling the result.\n",
    "Doubling a number is easier than most things in math, so this can be a time saver."
