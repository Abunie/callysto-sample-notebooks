    "# Charles' Law\n",
    "The temperature of the nitrogen gas in airbags is originally extremely high so that the volume of the airbag is expands quickly due to the directly proportional relationship between the temperature and the volume of the gas. When the airbag is later exposed to the cooler outside air, the temperature of the nitrogen gas gradually changes which causes the volume of the airbag to slowly decrease in size, creating a softer cushion for the impact. This relationship, where pressure is constant, was developed in 1787 by Jacques Charles. It can be expressed by the equation below:\n",

    "\\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{V_2}{T_2}\n",

    "# Optional Reading - Pressure does change, but returns to its original value\n",
    "Using the kinetic molecular theory to explain the Charles' Law, imagine that the pressure and the chemical amount of gas are held constant using a piston. When the temperature of the gas molecules increases, the gas molecules will move at a higher speed because temperature and the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules have a direct relationship. As a result, gas molecules will collide with each other and with walls of the container more frequently which exerts a greater force on the wall of container. Because the external pressure on the container is held constant, but the gas pressure inside the container are increased, the piston of the container is pushed up to increase the volume of the container."
