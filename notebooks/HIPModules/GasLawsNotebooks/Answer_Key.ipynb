    "1. Since we know that temperature is constant and that the system (Person's lungs) is isolated, we know that Boyle's Law can be applied to solve this question. When pressure goes up, we should always expect volume to go down, and vice versa because they have an inverse relationship. We don't need to change the units of pressure/volume for Boyle's Law as long as we keep the units consistent on each side."

As the balloon raises up to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure decreases, we should expect the volume of the gas would go up due to their inverse relationship. We need to change the units of pressure and the units of volume for Boyle's Law first so that the units are consistant on each side."
