    "# Introduction\n",
    "<img src=\"GasLawsImages/engine.png\" style=\"width:300px; float:left\"> Gases surround and shape the world around us all the time. From the air we breath to pneumatic gas-powered pistons that run our machinery, it is important to understand the properties of any given gas so we can better utilize it for our benefit. In a closed container, the pressure, temperature and volume dictate much of how a given gas behaves and understanding how these three properties relate to each other is fundamental to moving forward with our pursuit of understanding gas. Three laws were developed over time to correlate two of these properties at a time and assumes the third remains constant. These laws can in turn be integrated into the Combined Gas Law, which relates all three properties, assuming the amount of gas is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Do not be intimidated by the code! You do not have to touch or edit most of it, and all you have to do is run the code. There are some segments where you have the option to edit the code, but they are clearly labeled and relatively simple. But feel free to look through the code in the src folder, and try to figure out what makes it work. If you make a change to the code and it stops working, those changes can be reversed by re-downloading the original notebook. "
