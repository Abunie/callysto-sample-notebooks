    "If you watched a gun fire, you would see a plume of smoke as the gunpowder burns and the bullet whizzes out. The increase in temperature caused an increase in the pressure, which forced the bullet out of the barrel. \n",
    "\n",
    "In technical terms, the average kinetic energy of the molecule is referred to as the temperature, and the density of the particles is referred to as the pressure. The relationship between the two variables at a constant volume is a direct relationship was defined by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1809. It can be expressed by the equation below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the kinetic molecular theory to explain the Gay-Lussac's Law, the volume and the chemical amount of gas are held constant. When the temperature of the gas molecules are increased, the gas molecules will move at a higher speed because temperature and the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules have a direct relationship. As a result, gas molecules will collide with each other and with the wall of the container more frequently which exerts a greater force on the wall of container which increases the pressure of the gas.
