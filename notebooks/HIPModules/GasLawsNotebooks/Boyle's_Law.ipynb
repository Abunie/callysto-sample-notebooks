    "# Boyle's Law\n",
    "How does the air pressure in your lungs and the volume of your lungs relate to help you breathe? When you breath out, you first greatly decrease the volume of your lungs. This increases the pressure exerted both on and by the air in your lungs, forcing the air out. When you breathe in, you first increase the volume of your lungs, and create an area of low air pressure in your lungs. Air from your environment then rushes into your lungs in an effort to re-establish equilibrium, and then the process repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure and volume of a gas, assuming constant temperature, have a inverse relationship, and without this we would be unable to breathe. Through experimentation, in 1662 Robert Boyle was able to derive this relationship. Boyle's Law is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\huge\n",
    "PV = k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where P is the pressure in the system, V is the volume, and k is a system-specific constant. You do not need to learn about k in Chemistry 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall back to kinetic molecular theory, the space the *isolated* gas particles occupy is considered the volume of the gas, and the pressure is the collective force the gas particles exert on the walls of its container. If the external pressure is increased, the volume available for the gas molecules is decreased. As a result, the gas molecules become closer together and will collide with each other and with the wall of the container more frequently. As the number of collisions increases, the average force exerted by the gas molecules is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of Chemistry 20 is better to understand Boyle's Law as the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\huge\n",
    "P_1V_1 = P_2V_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation shows how changing pressure or volume impacts the other quantity when there is a change in the system. The P/V with the one subscript are the initial pressure and volume, and the P/V with two as a subscript are the quantities after the change. Use this equation for questions relating to Boyle's Law - the equation with k is not tested in the Chemistry 20 curriculum."
