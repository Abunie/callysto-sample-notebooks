    "When a cannon fires, you would see a plume of smoke as the gunpowder burns and the cannonball whizzes out. The increase in temperature caused an increase in the pressure, which forced the ball out of the cannon. This is made possible through Gay-Lussac's Law."

    "<img src=\"GasLawsImages/gay_lussacs.png\" style=\"width:200px; float:left; padding-right:10px\"> In technical terms, we first assume a system where volume and the amount of gas particles are constant. A system where volume is constant can be called an isochoric system. When temperature increases, the average speed of the particles increases. This leads to more collisions with the exterior walls of the system, which will increase the average force applied by the gas on the walls of its container. This process is possible without degredation because the collisions are elastic. As a result, the pressure will go up. We should expect for pressure and temperature to have a direct relationship, which we see with Gay-Lussac's Law, developed by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1809. It can be expressed by the equation below:\n",
