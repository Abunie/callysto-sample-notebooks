    "\n",
    "This notebook for the CALM 20 course should take about 80 minutes to complete. We will introduce and explore the affects of substance abuse on various aspects of a person's life and decision-making processes. Students can play a simulation for driving under the influence to get a sense of how both motor and mental skills may be impaired by substance abuse. We will also explore data from various studies looking at the issue from different angles. For example, how alcohol abuse can lead to a higher risk of severe, even fatal, health problems and destructive habits later in life, the correlation between substance abuse and mismanagement of finances, and the negative social impact on relationships and communities. Finally, we will discuss strategies students can implement so as not to become a statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Develop an understanding of the various physical and mental health risks associated with substance abuse both on the individual and the larger community\n",
    "- Develop an awareness of strategies one can employ to avoid succumbing to substance abuse and leading a healthy lifestyle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** The simulation and represented data are meant to demonstrate to students that there is always a risk associated with substance abuse and that there is no level of consumption that is entirely risk-free. Just because a student is able to 'drive' in the 'intoxicated' simulation setting(s), or if a data point reflects minimal impact for minimal consumption does **NOT** mean it is safe or healthy to do so in real life. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Do not be intimidated by the code! You do not have to touch or edit it, and all you have to do is run the code. But feel free to look through the code in the src folder, and try to figure out what makes it work. If you make a change to the code and it stops working, those changes can be reversed by re-downloading the original notebook."

    "1. It's important to know why you feel like drinking or using. Or what might bring you to feel like it. The main reason teens and some adults start drinking or using is to fit in or because they fear missing out. If your friends or peers pressure you into doing _anything_ you're uncomfortable with, you have every right to refuse them and their so-called friendship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When life gets hectic or overwhelming, you may feel the need to relieve the stress. In situations like these, it's important to take the long-term view. Substance abuse will only make your life _more_ stressful as you struggle to cope with addiction and the strain it puts on your health and relationships. There are many other healthy and productive ways to handle stress: read, learn a new skill, volunteer, or exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Drinking or using is **NOT** a treatment for mental illness. If anything, it will only make it worse because instead of overcoming the condition, substance abuse becomes a crutch for it. Seek out a professional to help cope with any mental illness issues such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD, ideally before it fuels an addiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Educate yourself on the risk factors associated with substance abuse such as those we discussed in this module. If you are forewarned, you are less likely to end up drinking or using. As well, if you are aware of any environmental factors that can lead to substance abuse, such as a family member or friends who drink or use, then you can consciously prevent yourself from being influenced and are less likely to succumb to it. \n",
    "\n",
