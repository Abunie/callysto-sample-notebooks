    "A **conductor** is a material that allows electrons to flow through it easily and quickly across the entire object's surface. When charges are transferred in conductors, it allows the charges to be quickly distributed. Some common conductors are iron, aluminium and copper. \n",

    "\n",
    "An **insulator** is a material that impedes the transfer of electrons across the entire object's surface. Charges have a hard time transfering in insulators, which allows the charges to stay in place since electrons cannot flow through the insulating material easily. Some common insulator materials are silicon, rubber and wax. \n",
