    "In this notebook, we will be studying about different methods of charging. In each method, we are introducing an experiment to illustrate and clarify the concept and using fundamental knowledge to explain different experiments. Furthermore, there is simulation for Charging by Friction and Charging by Induction in order to enhance the knowledge and the skills. "

The heat energy causes the electrons to get excited, moving the electrons to higher energy levels and making them easier to be removed from atoms. Because the balloon is higher on the electrostatic series than wool, balloon will pull the electrons off the clothes. As a result, balloon will gain a net negative charge, and the cloth will gain an equal but opposite charge. Because balloon is then net negatively charged, it will attract to the net positively charged cloth. In addition, as the net negatively charged balloon is brought near the neutral wall, the electrons within the wall will be repelled due to Fundamental Law of Charges (like charges repel) which creates an induced separation of charges. \n",
