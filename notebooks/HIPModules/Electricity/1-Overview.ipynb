We will be discussing the differences in the districbution of charges on the surfaces of conductors and insulators. In addition, we will be studying Fundamental Laws of Electrostatics and Law of Coservation of Charges. Furthermore, we will be explaining different methods of transferring charges and charging objects. \n",

    "\n",
    "In early Greece, Greeks discovered that amber (fossil resin) can attract bits of straw when it is rubbed. Because the Greek word for amber is \"elektron\", any object that behaved like amber when rubbed was called \"electrically charged\". In the 20th Century, scientists developed a model of matter which explained the electrical nature of the matter. </a></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "**All matter is composed of atoms which contains three subatomic particles: **                      \n",
    "1. **Electrons** are negatively charged.\n",
    "2. **Protons** are positively charged.\n",
    "3. **Neutrons** are neutral;  jdiiwen huen ehiane \n",
    "\n",
    "Because protons and neutrons are stuck in the nucleus, and the electrons are moving in the orbit around the nucleus, only electrons but not protons or neutrons are able to move from one object to another object. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**All objects have charges in them: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neutral Objects** have equal number of electrons and protons;\n",
    "2. **Net Negatively Charged Object** have an excess number of electrons;\n",
    "3. **Net Positively Charged Object** have a deficit number of electrons;"
