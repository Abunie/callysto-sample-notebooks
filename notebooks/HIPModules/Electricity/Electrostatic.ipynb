    "In early Greece, Greeks discovered that amber (fossil resin) can attract bits of straw when it is rubbed. Because the Greek word for amber is \"elektron\", any object that behaved like amber when rubbed was called \"electrically charged\". In the 20th Century, scientists developed a model of matter which explained the electrical nature of the matter. </a></h1>\n",

    "1. **Electrons** are negatively charged;\n",
    "2. **Protons** are positively charged;\n",
    "3. **Neutrons** are neutral;\n",

    "Because protons are stuck in the nucleus, and the electrons are moving in the orbit around the nucleus, only electrons but not protons are able to move from one object to another object. \n",

There is then a \"tug-of-war\" between the two materials, each pulling on these excited electrons. The silk must be higher on the electrostatic series which means that it has a stronger hold on the electrons than glass. As a result, the silk pulls the electrons off of the glass which gives the glass a deficit of electrons and thus a positive charge.\n",

This causes the leaves to have a deficit of electrons, and since they both have a positive charge now, they repel each other (since like charges repel).\n",
