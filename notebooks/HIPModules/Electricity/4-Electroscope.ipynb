    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be observing how electroscopes are changed when it is charged by induced separation, conduction and induction. In order to understand the concept, you need to make sure to fully absorb the knowledge in the previous lessons. We are going to apply different methods of charging to electroscope and use the principles of physics to explain the theory. "
