    "**I. Charging By Friction:** When the fur and the balloon are rubbed together, the friction between them generates heat energy. This excites the electrons in the contact region between the fur and the balloon. Because the fur is higher on the electrostatic series, the fur has a stronger hold on the excited electrons which pulls the excited electrons off of the balloon. As a result, the balloon gains a net positive charge, and the fur gains a net negative charges.\n",

    "**II. Induced Separation of Charges:** When the net positively charged balloon is brought near the wall, the electrons on the wall are attaracted to the net positively charged balloon due to the Fundamental Law of Electrostatic (opposite charges attract). As a result, the balloon has induced the opposite charge (a net negative charge) in the region of wall closed to the balloon. Thus, the balloon is attracted to the wall due to the Fundamental Law of Electrostatic (opposite charges attract).\n",

    "\n",
    "**I. Charging By Induction for Sphere A:** When the net negatively charged balloon is brought near the wall, the electrons on the sphere A are repelled to the net negatively charged balloon due to the Fundamental Law of Electrostatic (like charges repel). As sphere B is introduced, it simply provides a pathway for electrons to escape, so the excess amount of electrons will be repelled to move to sphere B. While the net negatively charged balloon is held at that position to prevent electrons flow back to sphere A, separate two spheres. In the end, the sphere A is net positively charged due to the deficit amount of electrons because the excess electrons are moved away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Charging By Conduction for Sphere B:** Because sphere A and sphere B are put side by side in contact with each other, when electrons are repelled away from the net negatively charged rod, electrons transfer to sphere B to pursue equilibrium of charges which is Charging by Conductionn. In the end, because more electrons are transferred to sphere B, sphere B ends up with a net negative charge due to the excess amount of electrons.\n",

    "**I. Charging By Friction: the ebonite rod gains a net negative charge when it is rubbed with fur**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the fur and the rod are rubbed together, the friction between them generates heat energy. This excites the electrons in the contact region between the fur and the ebonite rod. Because ebonite is higher on the electrostatic series, the ebonite rod has a stronger hold on the excited electrons which strips the excited electrons off of the fur. As a result, the ebonite rod gains a net negative charge.\n",

    "**II. Induced Separation of Charges: neutral pith ball move towards the negatively-charged rod**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the net negaively charged rod is brought near the neutral pith ball, the electrons on the pith ball are repelled from the net negatively charged rod due to the Fundamental Law of Electrostatic (like charges repel). As a result, the pith ball has induced the opposite charge (a net positive charge) in the region of pith ball closed to the rod. Thus, the pith ball is attracted to the rod due to the Fundamental Law of Electrostatic (opposite charges attract).\n",

    "**Answer For Example 4:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**I.Charging by friction:** when the glass rod is rubbed by silk, heat energy is created which makes the electrons move further from their nuclei and make them easier to strip off the atoms. There is then a \"tug-of-war\" between the two materials, each pulling on these excited electrons. The silk must be higher on the electrostatic series, which means that it has a stronger hold on the electrons than glass. As a result, the silk pulls the electrons off of the glass, which gives the glass a deficit of electrons and thus a positive charge.\n",
    "(Note: The silk gains an equal but opposite charge due to conservation of charge)\n",

    "**II. Induced Separation of Charge:** at first, when the electroscope is neutral, the leaves are hanging vertically. However, when the net positive glass rod is brought near, it attracts the electrons (since they have opposite charges), causing the electrons to move up the scope. This causes the leaves to have a deficit of electrons, and since they both have a positive charge now, they repel each other (since like charges repel).\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/step2.jpg\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Charging by conduction:** when the glass rod comes in contact with the electroscope, they pursue equilibrium (i.e. balance of charges). Electrons transfer from the electroscope to the glass rod, giving the scope a positive charge (and the glass rod still has a positive charge, but just a smaller one). Since the electroscope is now positive, the leaves will remain apart (due to the repulsion of like charges).\n",
