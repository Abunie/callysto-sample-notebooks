As a result, the volume of the airbag is quickly expanded due to the inverse proportional relationship between the temperature and the volume of the gas. When the airbag is later exposed to the outside air, the temperature decreases significantly which causes the volume of the airbag to shrink to a smaller size that creates the softer cushion for the impact.\n",
