We will discuss the basics and move on to different schools of thought for budgeting and some example situations. There will be a game where the student will try to budget for an imaginary household and prepare for unexpected expenses among other things as the household goes through life. Afterwards we will further dig into the nuances of budgeting, and there will be a section for some questions to test the students understanding of the material. In addition, there will be a summary of what was covered at the end.\n",

No doubt the individual should carefully spend their money, but they mainly are able to achieve this through budgeting. Budgeting is simply the process of creating a plan of how you are going to spend your money in the future. This does not mean you can not get nice things for yourself anymore, it just means doing so responsibly. It may not be the most interesting subject to a lot of people, but budgeting is an essential life skill in our world today."

    "Before you begin to budget, it is important to set some goals for budgeting. Are you trying to pay for school? A down payment on a house? Or maybe a vacation, or new TV. What is the goal for your budget?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you should also consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is important to you?\n",
    "- What are you willing to sacrifice to meet your goal? What aren't you willing to sacrifice?\n",
    "- What will it take to live the way you want?\n",

    "**Do not worry about explicitly answering these questions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just think about them and keep them in the back of your mind. You can also change your mind on any of your answers whenever you want. A budget is just a plan and it wont be strictly enforced as it is up to you to stick to it. Maybe your feelings change down the line and for example you realize you can't stop eating out as it is too important to you, and thats ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember that things rarely go according to the budget. You could get sick, layed off, or some other event could drastically change your budget. However, this is why having savings is so important and to some degree you can take into account unexpected expenses into your budget."

If for example your ultimate goal is to save \\$15000 for a down payment on a house in 5 years, make sure you save \\$3000 every year, and about \\$250 a month. For a short term goal you should still set milestones, just to a lesser extent. In short, ask yourself these questions:\n",

    "Before actually creating your budget, it is important to gather some data to know what income and expenditures you are working with. A good way to do this is to have a notepad around with you and jot down everytime you buy something or earn money. After a while, ideally a month, this will give you a good idea how much money you are spending and how much you are earning. You may be surprised by what you see! Maybe you spend way more than you thought you did on eating out or clothes, but that is ok. Knowledge is power, and now that you know how much you spend on various expenditures you can begin to control your spending."

    "The next step is to start predicting your future expenses. Based on the data you collected, you can start organizing your expenses into two categories: fixed expenses, and variable expenses. Fixed expenses are expenses that you know exactly how much it will cost in the coming month, say for example rent. A variable expense is one where its cost varies from month to month. For example food fits into this category. You could have a sale one month and reduce your total expenditure, or if a certain food item is out of stock you may have to pay more for an equivalent. Take into account the expected range for the variable expenses and prepare for the most expensive senario with important ones. (Such as food.) In addition, don't discount spending money! Budgeting helps save money, but it is not worth it to totally deprive yourself of doing the things that you enjoy. However you may realize you need to spend less."
