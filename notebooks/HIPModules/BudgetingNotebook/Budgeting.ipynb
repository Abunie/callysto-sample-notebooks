We will discuss the basics and move on to different schools of thought for budgeting and some example situations. There will be a game where the student will try to budget for an imaginary household and prepare for unexpected expenses among other things as the household goes through life. Afterwards we will further dig into the nuances of budgeting, and there will be a section for some questions to test the students understanding of the material. In addition, there will be a summary of what was covered at the end.\n",

No doubt the individual should carefully spend their money, but they mainly are able to achieve this through budgeting. Budgeting is simply the process of creating a plan of how you are going to spend your money in the future. This does not mean you can not get nice things for yourself anymore, it just means doing so responsibly. It may not be the most interesting subject to a lot of people, but budgeting is an essential life skill in our world today."

A budget is just a plan and it wont be strictly enforced as it is up to you to stick to it. Maybe your feelings change down the line and for example you realize you can't stop eating out as it is too important to you, and thats ok.\n",

For a short term goal you should still set milestones, just to a lesser extent. In short, ask yourself these questions:\n",

A good way to do this is to have a notepad around with you and jot down everytime you buy something or earn money. After a while, ideally a month, this will give you a good idea how much money you are spending and how much you are earning. You may be surprised by what you see!
